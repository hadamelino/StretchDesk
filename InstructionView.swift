Feel free to adjust them to suit your preferences by tapping the left most button (timer). \n\nThe timer has three different colors to indicate the detection output:\n- Yellow\t: The app is waitting for your movement \n- Green\t: The hand movement matches the current exercise and will start counting down \n- Red\t\t: The detected movement does not match with the current exercise \n\nLet's begin with the Wrist Shake Exercise, followed by the Wrist Circles Exercise. The detailed instructions for each exercise movement are provided below. Have a good experience!\n")
